The requests hit our servers, and we route your data to any destination you want!\n\nSegment has native sources for most use cases (Javascript, iOS, etc.) that are all built for high-performance and are open-source. But sometimes you may want to send to the HTTP API directly—that’s what this reference is for.\n\nhttps://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api",
